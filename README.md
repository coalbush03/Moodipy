Plan for now:

Function calculating mood of the song (some simple calculations based on energy,danceability, loudness, liveness, bpm)

3 modules

1. Analyzing overall mood of our last 50 songs - our recent mood
2. Analyzing overall mood of user's playlists and sorting them accordingly (consider multiple types of mood with seperate calculations for them?)
3. Creating a playlist from tracks reccomended to the user according to the mood they choose


Maybe in future do that in a form of web app
